# Import Jb for IDEA
This [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9970-import-cost) displays the size of the imported JavaScript package right in the editor. 
It can be installed in WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm, PyCharm Pro, and RubyMine v2017.2 and above. 

This plugin uses the [Import Cost](https://github.com/wix/import-cost) module that uses webpack with babili-webpack-plugin to calculate the size of the imported module.

You can read about the original idea behind the Import Cost module in this [blog post by Yair Haimovitch](https://medium.com/@yairhaimo/keep-your-bundle-size-under-control-with-import-cost-vscode-extension-5d476b3c5a76).
